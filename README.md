# Investigate-a-Dataset
This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree course requirements.
# Introduction
In this project, I analyzed a dataset named "noshowappointments".<br>
I used python libraries 'Python', 'Numpy', and 'Matplotlib' to make data analysis more easier.<br>
Dataset collected of 100k appointments made in medical offices in Brazil. Data shows patients who have made appointments but who have not showed up. What are some of the commonalities behind persons not showing up? Here is an attempt to give some possible reasons why
# Analysis
In this project, I have done analysis to see how everything fits together.<br>
Later projects wil fpcus on individual pieces od the data analysis process.<br>
In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.<br>
Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.
# Tools Used
I used python libraries Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib which make data analysis code in python easier.
# Conclusion
I understood the steps involved int he data analysis process.<br>
Posing questions using python numpy and getting answers from the dataset.<br>
Familiarized with the pandas series and DataFrame objects which let access data more conveniently.
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.<br>
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle data in certain format.<br>
Know matplotlib to plot the charts which visualize the data to understand more easily.
